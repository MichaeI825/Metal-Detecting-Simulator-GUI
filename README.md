# Information about the GUI & Credits

The Auto Complete Captcha feature in this GUI just automatically completes a Captcha that comes up once in a while while you're afk. And when you complete that captcha, you get gems. Just wanted to specify that because I thought people wouldn't know what that is. Please add my Discord and let me know if there are any errors or bugs with the GUI as I will try my best to fix them.
